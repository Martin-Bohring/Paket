The paket.local file
===================

The `paket.local` file is used for testing changes before releasing new version of a dependent project.

> Note: you **shouldn't commit** `paket.local`. This file should always be added to `.gitignore`, because it specifies file paths that are only accessible on your machine.

Sample use case 
---------------

In this tutorial you will learn how `paket.local` can help you to speed up your development process.

The Paket project uses [Argu](http://fsprojects.github.io/Argu/) as one of its own dependencies. Argu is a library that allows to manage command line parameters:

`paket.dependencies` ([browse](https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/blob/master/paket.dependencies))

    [lang=paket]
    source https://nuget.org/api/v2
    
    nuget Argu
    ...

When running [`paket restore`](file:///C:/github/Paket/docs/output/paket-restore.html), the Argu package is always restored from the NuGet source that was specified in Paket's own `paket.lock` file:

    [lang=paket]
    NUGET
      remote: https://www.nuget.org/api/v2
      specs:
        Argu (2.1)
    ...

Now let's assume that we want to contribute to Paket by adding a new feature.
The new feature, however, requires a change to Argu, so we'll need to contribute to the Argu project first.

Before we create a Pull Request to Argu, we might want to test the change locally by running Paket with the applied change in the Argu package.  
Up until now, there was no convenient mechanism to do so, and e.g. we would manually copy updated Argu libraries to the packages folder in Paket's project after each rebuild.

With the `paket.local` file, we can improve this process, by **temporarily overriding** the source for a specific package. We create a `paket.local` file in the root of own Paket source code copy:

    [lang=paket]
    nuget Argu -> git file:///c:\github\Argu feature_branch build:"build.cmd NuGet", Packages: /bin/

The line above basically says: whenever `paket restore` is run, **override** the source of the Argu package with the source given after `->`.

Now when running `paket restore`, we get the following:

    [lang=bash]
    $ .paket\paket.exe restore
    Paket version 3.0.0.0
    paket.local override: nuget Argu -> file:///c:\github\Argu feature_branch build:"build.cmd NuGet", Packages: /bin/
    Setting C:\github\Paket\paket-files\localfilesystem\Argu to b14ea1a00431335ca3b60d49573b3831cd2deeb4
    Running "C:\github\Paket\paket-files\localfilesystem\Argu\build.cmd NuGet"
    11 seconds - ready.

As a result:

* the build command `build.cmd NuGet` is triggered for Argu on `feature_branch` 
* a new Argu NuGet package is built by this command in the `/bin/` directory
* the Argu NuGet package is extracted to `packages/Argu` directory in the Paket project folder
* Paket can be run and tested with the updated Argu library

> Note: Any override specified in `paket.local` will result in a **warning** upon running `restore` as in the above example. 
This is to emphasize that we have a local override, and the build might not be reproducible on any other machine.

Format
------

Each line in `paket.local` means one override - you can have multiple overrides at once:

    [lang=paket] 
    nuget Argu -> git file:///c:\github\Argu feature_branch build:"build.cmd NuGet", Packages: /bin/
    nuget Fake -> source c:\github\FAKE\bin
    

> Note: [groups](groups.html) are not supported yet. Override applies only to "Main" group.

### Git override

    [lang=paket] 
    nuget Argu -> git file:///c:\github\Argu feature_branch build:"build.cmd NuGet", Packages: /bin/

Format of git source is the same as used in `paket.dependencies` for specifying [git repositories](git-dependencies.html#Using-Git-repositories-as-NuGet-source).

> Note: only **git repositories as NuGet source** (with `Packages: ...`) are currently supported

### Source override

    [lang=paket] 
    nuget Fake -> source c:\github\FAKE\bin

The Format of the source is the same as in [path sources](nuget-dependencies.html#Path-sources).

> Note: In case of source override, `paket restore` assumes the NuGet package **already exists** in   pointed directory - no build is going to be triggered.

### Comments

All lines starting with with `//` or `#` are considered comments.

    [lang=paket]
    // this line is treated as comment
    nuget Fake -> source c:\github\FAKE\bin

Comments might prove helpful if you use `paket.local` override on regular basis - instead of typing the override by hand, you can just comment/uncomment relevant line:

    [lang=paket]
    // uncomment below to override FAKE package
    // nuget FAKE -> source C:\github\FAKE\bin
