## Creating NuGet-Packages

Consider the following [`paket.dependencies` file][depfile] in your project's root:

    [lang=paket]
    source https://nuget.org/api/v2

    nuget Castle.Windsor ~> 3.2
    nuget NUnit

And one of your projects having a [`paket.references` file][reffile] like this:

    [lang=paket]
    Castle.Windsor

Now, when you run `paket install`, your [`paket.lock` file][lockfile] would look like this:

    [lang=paket]
    NUGET
      remote: https://nuget.org/api/v2
        Castle.Core (3.3.3)
        Castle.Windsor (3.3.0)
          Castle.Core (>= 3.3.0)
        NUnit (2.6.4)

Now, when you are done programming and wish to create a NuGet-Package of your project, create a [`paket.template`][templatefile] file with `type project` and run:

    [lang=batch]
    paket pack output nugets version 1.0.0

Or, you could run:

    [lang=batch]
    paket pack output nugets version 1.0.0 lock-dependencies

Depending on which command you issue, Paket creates different version requirements of the packages you depend on in the resulting `.nuspec` file of your package:

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Dependency</th>
    <th>Default</th>
    <th>With locked dependencies</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Castle.Windsor</td>
      <td><code>[3.2,4.0)</code></td>
      <td><code>[3.3.0]</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

As you see here, the first command (without the `lock-dependencies` parameter) creates version requirements as specified in your [`paket.dependencies` file][depfile]. The second command takes the currently resolved versions from your [`paket.lock` file][lockfile] and "locks" them to these specific versions.

### Symbol Packages

Visual Studio can be configured to download symbol/source versions of installed packages from a symbol server, allowing the developer to use the debugger to step into the source (see [SymbolSource](http://www.symbolsource.org/Public/Home/VisualStudio)).
These symbol/source packages are the same as the regular packages, but contain the source files (under `src`) and PDBs alongside the DLLs.
Paket can build these symbol/source packages, in addition to the regular packages, using the `symbols` parameter:

    [lang=batch]
    paket pack output nugets symbols

### Including referenced projects

Paket automatically replaces inter-project dependencies with NuGet dependencies if the dependency has it's own [`paket.template`][templatefile].
In addition to this the switch `include-referenced-projects` instructs Paket to add project output to the package for inter-project dependencies that don't have a paket.template file.

1. It recursively iterates referenced projects and adds their project output to the package 
2. When combined with the [symbols switch](paket-pack.html#Symbol-Packages), it will also include the source code of the referenced projects.  Also recursively.
3. Any projects that are encountered in this search that have their own project template are ignored.

### Version ranges

By default Paket uses the specified version ranges from the [`paket.dependencies` file][depfile] as version ranges for dependencies of the new NuGet package.
by using the `minimum-from-lock-file` parameter the dependencies of the generated NuGet will use the versions from the [`paket.lock` file][lockfile].
